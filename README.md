# Skinner: Melanoma detection based on deep convolutional neural networks

This code corresponds to our work with [Pablo Rubí](github.com/blito) on melanoma detection based on deep convolutional neural networks.

As we are working on a publication right now, please do not use this code until we have a citation for you to include in your papers :-)

##Abstract

To do.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

We make use of some external libraries in our code, namely:

 - numpy, scipy
 - pyyaml
 - HDF5 and h5py (optional, required if you use model saving/loading functions)
 - Optional but recommended if you use CNNs: cuDNN.
 - Keras with Tensorflow back-end.

Instructions to install each of these libraries are included in their official websites.

### Installing

 1. Create a fork of this repository, or clone it by doing:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/ignaciorlando/skinner
```
 2. Download ISBI 2016 challenge training data and labels from [here](https://challenge.kitware.com/#phase/5667455bcad3a56fac786791).

> **Note:** We tested this code on a Macbook PRO Retina 2015 with macOS Sierra, and in Ubuntu 14.10. In principle there would be no problem on using it within other architectures or operating systems.

## Running experiments

To do.
